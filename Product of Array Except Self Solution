We are given an array nums and need to return an array ans where ans[i] contains product of all elements in nums except nums[i].

Approach 1: Bruteforce

Here, we can consider 3 cases:
    Case 1: when there is exactly 1 zero in the array, we return an array of zeroes except for the element that was zero in the original array.
    Case 2: when there are more than 1 zeroes in the array, we return an array of zeroes.
    Case 3: when there are no zeroes in the array, we return the product of array except self using a simple traversal of the array.
